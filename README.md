# Home Assistant Automation Blueprints

This is going to be a collection of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) [Blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/using_blueprints/) that I made for my own home. 

Improvements, comments, and feedback are more than welcome!

## List

- [Blind Safety](blind_safety.yaml): stops and opens a closing blind/cover, if the corresponding window is opened while the blind is closing.
- [Notifications to close an open door or window](reminder_to_close_window.yaml): sends two notifdications to close a door or window after a number of minutes, if the outside temperature is below a set degree. 
- [Notifications to close an open door or window (with temperature sensor)](reminder_to_close_window_with_temp_sensor.yaml): sends two notifications to close a window or door after opening it, if the temperature reading of a given sensor is below a certain degree.
